Welcome to the repository for our journal article entitled "Decrypting the invasion of non-native cattails (<i>Typha</i> spp.) in the Fraser River Estuary, British Columbia, using morphological and microsatellite analyses", which was published in Estuaries and Coasts in 2025. 

You will find the following in this repository:

#### [Publication Files](https://github.com/asarum-ecological/2025_TyphaMorph/tree/main/Publication%20Files)
  - a .pdf of the accepted manuscript
  - a .pdf of the digital supplemental materials 

#### [Spatial Data](https://github.com/asarum-ecological/2025_TyphaMorph/tree/main/Spatial%20Data)
  - precise locations of all <i>Typha</i> samples (morphological and genetic) in the estuary
  
#### [Field Data](https://github.com/asarum-ecological/2025_TyphaMorph/tree/main/Field%20Data)
  - morphological data collected in July 2020
    
#### [Plot Files](https://github.com/asarum-ecological/2025_TyphaMorph/tree/main/Plot%20Files)
  - R scripts to plot both the triangle plot and MDS plot 
  - HIest package as it was removed from CRAN repository post-analysis 
  - Raw data used in plots
    - HIest_Formatted_G.csv contains genetic marker data in which each columnin a locus and there are two 
    rows for each individual since the allele type is="codominant"
    - HIest_Formatted_P.csv contains the locus name, allele name, P1 allele frequency, P2 allele frequency. contains a seperate row for each allele 
    - GenAlExPoppr.csv contains all individuals and their alleles at particular loci which are listed in the 3rd row. It is formatted for calculating Bruvo's distance 
    - Typha_Mean_Data.csv contains morphological data used in randomForest analysis


The extent of non-native cattail in the estuary continues to be investigated. For an up to date map of field-verified cattail please visit this [link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Gxm6n921sl6ph-dF6LTEKDhTrqaUaCoK&ll=49.137229809022216%2C-123.15205739999999&z=11).
